     * example because no challenge can be satisfied. If the map has entries, their keys are the HTTP headers to be set,
     * the values are the header values for the key. If the first entry in the values list is {@code null}, or the whole
     * values list is {@code null}, the given header values replace any existing values for that header. Otherwise, all
     * header values are added additionally to eventually already existing ones.

     * <i>Note:</i> It might be advisable to not return the same set of headers again if the originating request already
     * contained these headers. If the authenticator is called again, obviously the authentication did not work
     * properly. So returning the same headers again might end up in an endless loop.
